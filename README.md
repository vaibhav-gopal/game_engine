# Rust Game Engine

So this is a game engine built with Rust using the Vulkan Graphics API and the SDL library (via both of their appropriate rust wrappers).

There a couple goals for this project:

- Use as little external dependencies as possible (excluding hardware abstraction libraries)
- Be able to display 3D meshes
- Make a working lighting engine
- Upload and utilize textures
- Be able to import 3D models from Blender
- Implement an ECS (Entity Component System) for various game actors and objects
- Have a basic physics engine
- Create a small game with it (maybe something like quake 3 or old doom)
